# SpeedBreaker on SteamOS without a distrobox (a Steam Deck, a Steam Machine,
# a Steam Frame): add this script to Steam as a non-Steam game (README.md next
# to it). It is the only program at the top of this folder: it runs the game,
# lib/SpeedBreaker, with the libraries in lib/ (the game on its own can't pick
# them: started directly it fails, e.g. "GLIBC_2.44 not found"), and logs to
# last-run.log here;
# the run before stays as previous-run.log, so a relaunch after a crash
# doesn't lose it. SpeedBreaker's own options pass through
# (`speedbreaker.sh --install <image>`), and NFSMW_* settings can go in Steam's
# launch options, e.g. `NFSMW_DEADZONE=0.12 %command%`.
#
# The x86-64 game is built in a rolling Arch distrobox
# (scripts/steamos/make_bundle.sh made this folder), newer than SteamOS, so:
#   lib/        SDL3, glslang, SPIRV-Tools: always these, never the system's.
#   lib/cxx/    libstdc++ and libgcc_s: used when newer than the system's.
#   lib/glibc/  the C library and its loader: used when the system's is older
#               than the one the game was built against. The game then starts
#               through that loader, and the system's own libraries (the
#               Vulkan loader, the GPU driver, X11, PipeWire) load against
#               this newer C library, which runs them as the system's would:
#               glibc keeps old symbol versions. A later SteamOS with a C
#               library as new runs the game on its own.
# The arm64 game (the Steam Frame's) is built on SteamOS itself, against its
# own C and C++ runtimes: its bundle has lib/ only, and runs on the system's.
# The Vulkan loader and GPU drivers always come from the system. The loader
# is given the library path as an option, not LD_LIBRARY_PATH, so programs the
# game starts (a file dialog) never see these libraries.
# NFSMW_BUNDLED_GLIBC=1|0 and NFSMW_BUNDLED_CXX=1|0 force a choice (debugging).

# Laptops with two GPUs: an Intel or AMD one in the processor, beside an
# NVIDIA graphics card. The game itself draws with the discrete GPU (its
# log's "[video] Vulkan devices:" line lists them all; NFSMW_GPU=<index or
# part of a name> picks another). With NVIDIA's own driver, this also turns
# on NVIDIA's PRIME render offload for the game, as NVIDIA documents for
# Vulkan programs: __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 enables NVIDIA's Vulkan layer,
# which lists the NVIDIA GPU first. The idea and its first version: GitHub
# PR #6 by lydacious (tested on an i9-13900H laptop with an RTX 3050: the game
# had run on the Intel GPU, and ran at 60 fps on the NVIDIA one).
# Only when a GPU is driven by NVIDIA's kernel driver, another GPU is in use
# beside it, and NVIDIA's Vulkan driver is where the Vulkan loader looks for
# drivers; never over a value already set (__NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=0 in
# Steam's launch options turns it off). Left out on purpose:
#   VK_DRIVER_FILES=<NVIDIA's driver only>: the other GPU would vanish, so a
#     broken NVIDIA driver (updated, not yet rebooted) would leave the game no
#     GPU instead of the integrated one, and NFSMW_GPU couldn't pick it; the
#     game prefers the NVIDIA GPU without it.
#   __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia: OpenGL only, which the game doesn't
#     use; it would only move programs the game starts (a file dialog, the
#     web browser) onto the NVIDIA GPU.
# One log line names the PCI GPUs (none on the Steam Frame, whose GPU isn't
# on PCI: no line) and what was done. tests/launcher_prime_test.sh runs these
# two functions on made-up /sys, /proc and Vulkan folders (<root>).
